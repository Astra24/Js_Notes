**JavaScript Programming**
**Prototype-based Object-oriented**
JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language. It used prototypes instead of classes. Objects are used to represent the real-world entity in the program.

**Interpreted Language** 
JavaScript is an interpreted programming language. It uses a just-in-time compilation technique at run-time.

**Event-Based Programming**
 JavaScript allows us to write codes that are executed differently under different events.

**Platform Independence** 
JavaScript codes are run on browsers. So irrespective of the machine, if the browser supports JavaScript, codes can run.

**Why Learn JavaScript?**
JavaScript is used on both the client-side and the server-side. On the client-side, the code is run and displayed by the browser. On the server-side, Node.js is used.

JavaScript is a platform-independent language. Any browser supporting JavaScript can run the code irrespective of the operating system.

JavaScript uses the just-in-time compilation technique. Since the compilation is handled at run time, JavaScript is considered an interpreted language.

JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. That is, a variable containing a number may be reassigned to a string.
